= tasks extracted into resources

how to avoid long pipeline files

splitting resources into separate files out from pipeline.yml

== prepare

let's say we have this big pipeline definition

.composed-pipeline.yml
[source,yaml]
----
jobs:
- name: pipeline
  public: true
  plan:
  - task: hola
    config:
      platform: linux
      image_resource:
        type: docker-image
        source: {repository: ubuntu}
      run:
        path: echo
        args: [who-hoo!!!]
----

.required environment variable
[source,bash]
----
docker-compose up
fly -t lite login -c http://0.0.0.0:8080 # username: concourse, password: changeme
fly -t lite set-pipeline -c composed-pipeline.yml -p 04
fly -t lite unpause-pipeline -p 04 # by default pipelines creates paused
----

== playground

and we wanna do some decomposition of our pipelines to split it in logic reusable blocks

.create decomposed-pipeline.yml and decomposed-resource.yml files
[source,bash]
----
touch decomposed-pipeline.yml decomposed-resource.yml
----

.decomposed-pipeline.yml
[source,yaml]
----
resources:
- name: pipeline-resources
  type: git
  source:
    uri: https://github.com/daggerok/concourse-examples.git
jobs:
- name: pipeline
  public: true
  plan:
  - get: pipeline-resources
  - task: hola
    file: pipeline-resources/04-tasks-extracted-into-resources/decomposed-resource.yml
----

.decomposed-resource.yml
[source,yaml]
----
platform: linux
image_resource:
  type: docker-image
  source: {repository: ubuntu}
run:
  path: echo
  args: [who-hoo!]
----

.now apply pipeline updates via patch
[source,bash]
----
fly -t lite set-pipeline -c decomposed-pipeline.yml -p 04
